# SmartNG
[Electron](https://electron.atom.io/)-based [NGClient](https://wiki.servoy.com/display/public/DOCS/NGClient) wrapper

# Project Goals
The goals of this project are:

- __Primary__ - to provide an evergreen [electron](https://electron.atom.io/)-based wrapper for the [Servoy](https://servoy.com/) [NGClient](https://wiki.servoy.com/display/public/DOCS/NGClient) that can easily be added to existing Servoy deployments

- __Secundairy__ - enable enhancing the User Experience of [NGClient](https://wiki.servoy.com/display/public/DOCS/NGClient) solutions by offering the ability to integrate more seamlessly with the Desktop, see [Desktop Integrations](https://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/desktop-environment-integration/)

- __Tertiary__ - to ease the migration path of Servoy Smart Client-based solutions to the Servoy NGClient, for example by making Servoy Runtime API's that currently are exclusive to the Smart Client also work in the NGClient if running within SmartNG
